# split_landing_page

## Description

A landing page for two game consoles (could be any product). When the user hovers on one side that product display is enlarged to take over 75% of the screen size. The opposite happens when the user hovers over the right. If the user mouse is not hovering over any side, both product sides take up 50% of the screen size.

## Demo
